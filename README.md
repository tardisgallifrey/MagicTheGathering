<h1>A Magic the Gathering Card Database in C#</h1>
<hr>
This is a project I've been wanting to work on. It uses several things that I like.

<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
    <li>Magic the Gathering (c)Wizards of the Coast</li>
</ul>
<hr>
It is also a test project of mine to work on integrating C#, .NET Core 5.0, and EntityFrameworkCore into 
a project that is useful.

It makes use of EFCore's ability to create migrations and build SQL tables from Code Models.

It also makes heavy use of Enum classes for the various types and features of individual Magic the Gathering(c) playing cards.

Currently, it does very little.  I've just began the project.  If I can make it work in a console app, maybe I will eventually move it to a web app.

Use at your own caution.  No guarantees at all.
